# LL's overlay
My personal Gentoo overlay. 
Pull requests more than welcome.

UPDATE: I have accepted into GURU! \\:D/. I will upload all of my ebuilds there
and I'll leave this repo for testing purposes:

# TODO:
- [ ] Update dtreeviz ebuild
	- [ ] Add optional dependencies (Most of which are part of other people's overlays)
	- [ ] Fix tests
